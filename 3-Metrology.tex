\textit{This chapter briefly introduces the most frequently used characterization methods. Of major importance for the characterization of passivating contacts is the determination of the minority carrier lifetime, respectively the implied $V_{oc}$, and the contact resistivity $\rho_{c}$. The thickness and optical properties of Si thin films were investigated with spectroscopic ellipsometry. The microstructure of a-Si:H(i) was studied via infrared spectroscopy and the active dopant depth profile of SiTJs was measured with electrochemical capacitance-voltage profiling.}

The minority carrier lifetime $\tau$ of passivated Si wafers is commonly measured with the \ac{QSSPC} method \cite{Sinton.1996}. It is based on the contactless measurement of the Si wafer's photoconductance induced by a flash lamp. For that, in this work, a WCT-120 lifetime tester from Sinton Instruments was used. It measures the photoconductance via a coil acting as an eddy current sensor. The coil is supplied with an alternating current which induces a magnetic field. The magnetic field generates eddy currents within the sample, which in turn generate a secondary magnetic field the strength of which depends on the conductivity of the sample. Thus, from determining the impedance of the resonant circuit the time-dependent change of the sample's conductance due to the flash lamp illumination can be determined, which is linked to the excess charge carrier density $\Delta n$ via \cite{Sinton.1996}
\begin{equation}
	\Delta \sigma(t) = q \Delta n(t) (\mu_n + \mu_p) W,
\end{equation} 
with the wafer thickness $W$. Simultaneously, the flash light intensity is recorded over time by a reference photo cell. 
%a Xenon ash lamp illuminating the
%sample which is placed on a platform located above a coil and hence generated excess
%charge carriers denoted by the excess charge carrier density n. This comes along with
%an increase in conductivity, so called photo-conductivity , according to
%81]. To measure  a high-frequency eld is generated by the coil which is part of
%39
%a resonant circuit and induces eddy currents in the sample. Those currents inuence
%the impedance of the resonant circuit and depend on the conductivity of the sample
%and so . A change in conductivity hence can be determined by a voltage change in
%the resonant circuit. A great benet of the QSSPC measurement is that it is a nondestructive
%contactless method [81].
The continuity equation 
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\textrm{d}\Delta n(t)}{\textrm{dt}} = G(t) - U(t) -\frac{1}{q}\nabla J(t),
\end{equation}
describes the fact that a local increase or reduction of charge carriers is determined by the generation rate $G(t)$ and the recombination rate $U(t)$ of such carriers or a charge carrier flow.
$G(t)$ is dependent on the illumination intensity, the wafer thickness $W$ and an optical factor given by the reflection and absorption properties of the sample.
From that, one can derive an expression for the minority carrier lifetime \cite{Nagel.1999}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tau}
	\tau = \frac{\Delta n(t)}{G(t) - \frac{\textrm{d} \Delta n(t)}{\textrm{d}t}}.
\end{equation}
Here, depending on the flash duration $t_{flash}$, a distinction can be made between different modes. The quasi-steady mode utilizes a long flash $t_{flash} \gg  \tau$ with $\frac{\textrm{d} \Delta n(t)}{\textrm{d}t} = 0$ during the measurement and the quasi-transient mode utilizes a short flash $t_{flash} \ll  \tau$ and measures the decay of the photo-conductance \textit{after} the flash, thus $G=0$ can be assumed during the measurement. The latter mode is preferred for the typically high lifetimes $\tau > 200 ~\upmu \textrm{s}$ provided by passivating contacts and was thus usually used in this work. As an alternative, also a generalized analysis \cite{Nagel.1999} was applied, which takes Eq. \ref{eq:tau} fully into account and avoids the aforementioned approximations. As it considers non-zero generation during the measurement, it requires the optical factor of the sample as additional input parameter.

  


%nagel.1999: These errors limited
%the applicability of the quasi-steady-state and quasi-transient
%carrier lifetime measurements to the regimes t flash.10t eff
%and t flash,0.4t eff , respectively. The generalized analysis
%presented here avoids these approximations and hence substantially
%extends the applicability of the quasi-steady-state
%and quasi-transient methods beyond their previous limits.



%Leo: Moreover, from the quasi-steady state measurements an implied J-V curve can be approximated. For this, the excess carrier injection level within the device is varied between open and short circuit conditions by varying the illumination intensity (instead of draining a current, which is done in case of real J-V measurements). Assuming a linear relation between current gener-ation and illumination intensity I [suns], the current density values used for the implied J-V curve follow from
%??= ??sc (1???) ,
%(4-17)
%with a Jsc value required as input parameter. The implied voltage values are directly given by the splitting of the quasi-Fermi levels and can be calculat-ed from ?n(I) via equation (2-1).



From QSSPC measurements an implied $J-V$ characteristic can be extracted. The implied voltage i$V$ can be calculated from $\Delta n$ with Eq. \ref{eq:iV} in dependence of the illumination intensity. The $intensity-V$ characteristic can be transferred to the implied $J-V$ curve by assuming a linear correlation between the illumination intensity given as a multiple of solar irradiation ("suns") and the implied current density 
\begin{equation}
	J = J_{sc} (1-intensity),
\end{equation}
and selecting a suitable $J_{sc}$ value as input parameter.
The implied $J-V$ characteristic yields useful figures of merit for the recombination behavior of the sample, like the i$V_{oc}$ and the implied $FF$. 
%frank: which describe the maximum quasi-Fermi level splitting at 1 sun and the recombination
%behavior at implied MPP conditions, respectively
%
%leo: which are very useful parameters to characterize the recombination behavior of a structure in the relevant regime for solar cell operation.
The i$V_{oc}$ is denoted at one sun illumination, as this corresponds to the \ac{STC} of solar cells.
$\tau$ is stated at a specific injection level, in this thesis at $\Delta n = 10^{15} ~\textrm{cm}^{-3}$.  

%leo: However, the optical properties of the sample affect the injection level present within the wafer at one sun external illumination. This has to be considered, when comparing the recombination properties of samples with different optical properties by means of their iVoc.

%\paragraph*{QSSPL}
%
%leo: For spatially resolved information of the passivation quality of a sample, photoluminescence (PL) imaging was applied. Here ?eff is determined indi-rectly by detecting the radiative recombination of electrons and holes. For this, the samples are illuminated with monochromatic light with photon energy larger than the Si bandgap energy. The PL signal is then measured with a photo-detector. Here the strength of the radiative recombination is inversely dependent on the remaining recombination mechanisms. Hence, the spatial PL intensity profile indicates the recombination behavior across the sample.

%$\rho_c$ is most commonly measured via the \ac{TLM}, as described elsewhere...\cite{Schroder.2001,Basset.PhD}. BASSET:The method was first proposed [74] by Shockley in 1964, and formalized in 1969 by Berger [75].
%%The top view and side view sketch of the basic TLM structure is shown in Fig. \ref{..}. As indicated by the equivalent circuit (auch zeigen!), the total resistance of this structure $R_{t,TLM}$ can be written as
%%...
%%By measuring $R_{t,TLM}$ of several structures with different pad spacing one can plot $R_{t,TLM}$ vs. $d$ $d$ and extract $R_c$ from the y-intercept and $R_sheet$ from the slope of a linear fit to the data. 
%However, measuring rhoc of a passivated-contact stack with TLM is not straightforward, as additional interface resistances between the silicon wafer and the metallization occur compared to the ideal case in Fig. . 
%The author co-authored a article by Fell et al., in which this issue was addressed \cite{Fell.2020}. For a so-called "true"-passivated contact, as it is the case for both SHJ and the SiTJ structures investigated in this thesis, two contact resisitivites are of importance, namely $\rho_{met}$ and $\rho_{skin}$ (Fig. 1 ...aus fell paper), where $\rho_{skin}$ is the contact to the c-Si wafer.%also rhoc wo wie oben definiert, alles außer kontakt zum metall...
%For SHJ this additional resistance is mainly arising from the intrinsic a-Si:H layer and the doped a-Si/TCO interface [1], and for the TOPCon structure from the thin oxide layer. %These additional transport losses, which is here called a ?skin resistivity?, come in addition to the contact resistance between the skin and the metallization. 
%If $\rho_{skin}$ is high/not negligible compared to $\rho_{met}$, which is the case for all contacts under study here, and skin Rsheet values in the order of Rsheet values of the Si substrate (50-100 Ohm/sq)\footnotemark\footnotetext{Both is the case for the contacts under investigation with typical TCO Rsheet values of ~ 50-200 Ohm/sq in the SHJ contact stack and Rsheet values of heavily-doped poly-Si in the range 100-1000 Ohm/sq. }, only a small fraction or even no current is forced into the c-Si bulk, thus, apparent $\rho_c$ extracted from TLM does underestimates the actual $\rho_c$. In \cite{Fell.2020} this was shown by the underestimation of FF losses using the apparent $\rho_c$ extracted under these conditions. 
%%In this case it is possible to determine both ?skin,met and ?met by different test-structures, e.g. comparing a Cox-Strack measurement with a standard transfer-length-method (TLM) measurement [3].
%%For Rsheet = 80 Ohm/sq, a typical value for a passivating contact stack (TCO in SHJ, thicker, highly doeped poly-Si...), 
%To ensure current flow through all layers and interfaces of interest, one has to structure all these layers (or at least the ones with non-negligible Rsheet compared to the used substrate, here Si) and align the same contact pad pattern for all layers during or after deposition. 
%Further, the substrate used for lateral transport has to be thin compared to the pad spacing to satisfy the assumption of one-dimensional, horizontal current flow between to contact pads. 
%For SHJ this means that metal and TCO pattern have to be align, a-Si:H layer. In practice, for SHJ TLM is used with metal pads align on TCO patterns, while a-Si:H layers are usually kept full area, as their lateral conductivity is considered negligible \cite{leilaeioun,basset,usw.}. Patterning/alignment of patterns is done by using photolithography or by using the same shadow masks for both depositions or by etching the TCO between metal contact. For the latter, care has to be taken not to etch TCO also underneath the metal contacts, as this deteriorate the contact of interest.
%Regarding the poly-Si passivated contact, the poly-Si layer(s) have to be patterned in order to use TLM in a meaningful way. 
%
%For this work, these approaches were found too time consuming (photolithography) and impractical. 
%To this
%end, a practical and reliable method to measure the contact
%resistance of SHJs, without the necessity of etching or liftoff
%techniques, was used.

%aus leo basset: 
%TLM was originally developed in micro-electronics, where some contact resistivities are commonly reported below 10?6 ?.????² [127]. The spacing distances used in the TLM patterns are thus micrometric. Low distances therefore minimize the ???????????? contribution and allow good ???? signal. Additionally the use of high precision alignment and patterning techniques such as lithography is common in the microelectronics domain, but is not common in the PV domain, as the latter aims at low manufacturing costs.
%When studying high efficiency solar cells, contact resistance can also be very low [92]. However, we are dealing with more macroscopic objects and usual characterization techniques. TLM patterns are thus usually of millimeter to centimeter scale. This can generate impractical situations, where the ???? signal is completely drowned under the ???????????? signal.

%The contact resistivity ?c both between the Si thin-films and the TCO, as well as between the TCO and the metal electrodes are important parame-ters for the TCO process development performed in this work. Owing to the large conductivity of typical TCO films, the ?c at the metal / TCO interface can be obtained quite straightforwardly via the transfer length method (TLM) [102]. For TLM studies performed for device-like test structures on conductive Si wafers, the current flow was confined in the TCO layer by the insertion of a blocking p/n junction, electrically decoupling the metal / TCO system from the Si wafer.
%For quantifying the ?c at the TCO / Si thin-film interface, TLM requires the patterning of the conductive TCO layer in order to force the current into the Si below. To circumvent the need for TCO patterning,  Details of the individually applied test structures can be found in the experimental sections of the respective chapters.

The contact resistivity $\rho_c$ is an important parameter for the characterization of an electrical contact as it represents the resistive losses experienced by the contact's majority charge carrier, i.e., holes for the hole contact and electrons for the electron contact, when transported from the
semiconductor to the external electrode \cite{Bastiani.2020}.
In this sense, minimal $\rho_c$ maximizes the selective
carrier extraction by allowing the maximal flow of collected carriers
through the electrode \cite{Procel.2020}.

In this thesis, $\rho_c$ describes the whole contact stack of TCO/a-Si:H($n$/$p$)/a-Si:H($i$)/c-Si($n$) for the SHJ and poly-Si($p^+$)/poly-Si($n^+$)/ SiO$_x$/c-Si($n$) for the SiTJ, if not stated otherwise.
Therefore, $\rho_c$ comprises all combined interface and bulk
resistances of the contact materials. The contact resistivity to the metal $\rho_{met}$ is considered negligibly small compared to the other contributions.

A common method to measure $\rho_c$ is the \ac{TLM}, as described elsewhere (e.g., in Ref. \cite{Schroder.2006,Leilaeioun.2019,Basset.PhD}). 
However, measuring $\rho_{c}$ of a passivating-contact stack with TLM is not straightforward, as was shown in an article co-authored by the author \cite{Fell.2020}.
%For quantifying the ?c at the TCO / Si thin-film interface, TLM requires the patterning of the conductive TCO layer in order to force the current into the Si below. To circumvent the need for TCO patterning, the ?c at the interface of interest was addressed in this work via vertical J-V measurement through suitable test structures.
In this work, to avoid time-consuming structuring of conductive layers and to allow fast parameter screening, $\rho_c$ for the contacts of interest was extracted from transversal dark $J-V$ measurements of double-sided contacted test structures (Fig. \ref{fig:structures-Sim-2x2}). 
Let us first consider structure 1. The total resistance $R_t$ can be written as
\begin{align}\label{eq:Rt}
	R_t = R_c + R_{base} + R_{bc},
\end{align}
where $R_c$ is the contact resistance of interest and $R_{base}$ and $R_{bc}$ are the contributions of the c-Si bulk and the back contact, respectively. $\rho_c$ is then calculated from $R_c$ according to
\begin{align}\label{eq:rhoc}
	\rho_c = R_c \cdot A_c,
\end{align}
with the contact area $A_c$ defined by the metal area, which is for structure 1 equal to the sample area. Equations \ref{eq:Rt} and \ref{eq:rhoc} assume negligible resistance contribution within the metal layer and homogeneous current density distribution within the defined contact area $A_c$. Both can be assured with a sufficient lateral conductivity within the metal layer. The sample structure was realized by cutting the samples into $0.5 \times 0.5 ~\textrm{cm}^2$ squares with a dicing saw after full-area deposition of all required layers.
To extract $\rho_c$ from $R_t$, which was obtained by linear regression
around zero bias voltage, $R_{base}$ and $R_{bc}$ have to be known. $R_{base}$ was calculated using the nominal resistivity and thickness. With $R_{base}$ known, $R_{bc}$ can be determined from symmetrical structures ($R_{bc}=R_c$) with $R_{c}=\frac{1}{2}(R_t - R_{base})$. 
Please note that for $R_c \ll R_{base}$ computing of $R_c$ according to Equation \ref{eq:Rt} is based on the comparison of two large terms, making this approach unsuitable for the exact determination of very low $\rho_c$ values. The use of this approach in this work is justified as $R_c > R_{base}$ for most contacts under investigation.
This approach was used throughout this work to determine $\rho_c$ of poly-Si/SiO$_x$ and SiTJ structures shown in Section \ref{sec:routes-TJ}, Fig. \ref{fig:TJ-structures}.


For the SHJ structures, however, this approach was not reliably applicable because the metal layer delaminated from the TCO during cutting of the sample. For that reason, a different approach was used without the necessity of defining the contact area via cutting the sample (structure 2 in Fig. \ref{fig:structures-Sim-2x2}). Instead, the metal contact area at the front was defined using shadow masks during metal evaporation\footnotemark\footnotetext{Evaporated metal contacts were used for all data presented in this thesis since screen-printing did not allow for direct low-resistive contact formation to a-Si:H. For contacts where the metal is in contact with TCO, very similar $\rho_c$ were extracted for evaporated and screen-printed metal (not shown).} and TCO sputter deposition. 
By utilizing a contact area smaller than the c-Si base area, current flow becomes two-dimensional and current spreading in the c-Si wafer has to be taken into account. Current spreading within the c-Si bulk depends on the wafer
thickness and resistivity \cite{CoxStrack.1967} and lowers $R_{base}$, thus, can result in underestimation of $\rho_c$. 
In addition to that, current spreading
within the TCO occurs because of the gap between metal and
TCO window area needed for reliable alignment (see Fig. \ref{fig:2x2-top-view} in the appendix).\footnotemark\footnotetext{Current spreading within a-Si:H was found to be negligibly small due to very high $R_{sheet,a-Si:H}>10^4 ~\upOmega/\textrm{sq}$.} It is mainly determined by the
TCO sheet resistance $R_{sheet, TCO}$ and the contact resistivity $\rho_c$ between TCO, a-Si:H and c-Si bulk.
Since the latter two parameters can change with post-deposition annealing, exact evaluation is difficult. For that
reason, and to allow for practical alignment of TCO and metal
windows, a fairly large metal contact area ($2.0\times 2.0 ~\textrm{cm}^2 =
4.0 ~\textrm{cm}^2$) was chosen to reduce the impact of spreading resistance
on the total resistance \cite{CoxStrack.1967}. %R_base vergrößert sich mit 1/d2 (d=diameter), während spreading resistance mit arctan(1/d) langsamer steigt, R_spread/Rbase ungefähr 1 für große kontakte...
An error estimation using Quokka3 \cite{Fell.2017} simulations can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:error-2x2}.







%For the group 1 reference structures nNn
%and pPp without ITO, errors because of current spreading are
%smaller than 3% (corresponding to errors of ?c below 1 m?·cm²
%because of the low total resistance of the reference structures)
%and are neglected to extract the rear contact resistivity. 
%
%For that,
%bulk contributions Rbulk (according to nominal thickness and resistivity)
%are subtracted from the lowest obtained total resistance

In this work, \ac{SE} was mainly used as a non-destructive and easy-to-apply method to measure the thickness and optical properties of thin a-Si:H films on a c-Si substrate. For that, the difference of polarization state $\xi$ between the linearly polarized incident light beam and the light reflected on the sample's surface is measured. %, which depends on the optical properties of the sample under study. 
%The linearly polarized incident light beam is reflected on the sample's surface with a parallel (p)-polarized and perpendicular (s)-polarized component, expressed by the Fresnel reflection coefficients $r_p$ and $r_s$. 
The measured SE parameters $\Psi$ and $\Delta$ thereby denote the amplitude ratio and the phase difference induced by the reflection according to \cite{Schroder.2006}
\begin{equation}%up psi und delta möglich??
	\begin{split}
		\xi &= \frac{|E_p^{refl}|}{|E_p^{in}|} \frac{|E_s^{in}|}{|E_s^{refl}|} \exp(i(\delta_p^{refl}-\delta_p^{in} + \delta_s^{in} - \delta_s^{refl})) \\ 
		&= \frac{r_p}{r_s} =  \frac{|r_p|}{|r_s|}\exp(i\Delta_p-i\Delta_s) =  \tan(\Psi)\exp(i\Delta),
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
with the amplitude of the electromagnetic wave $E$ and the phase $\delta$ for parallel (p)-polarized and perpendicular (s)-polarized incident ($in$) and reflected ($refl$) light. $r_p$ and $r_s$ are the respective Fresnel reflection coefficients.
%Measuring around the Brewster angle of a sample, which ensures a large signal due to the large difference between rp and rs at this angle, together with the fact that the ratio of two quantities instead of an absolute value is measured, facilitates reproducible and accurate data acquisition. In this work mostly variable angle SE measurements were performed in the angle range around the Brewster angle for the air/c-Si interface, which amounts to 74° [96]. 
The angle of incident is chosen close to the Brewster angle (74° for the air/c-Si interface \cite{Stuckelberger.PhD}) because in that case $r_p$ is very small and the sensitivity to $r_s$ is very high \cite{Faltermeier.PhD}.

%penn.master: The set up used in this work was an M-2000 Rotating Compensator (RCE) configuration from J. A. Woollam with a spectral range from 250 nm to 1000 nm. All measurements were performed at 65 °, 70 ° and 75 ° angles of incidence which were manually adjusted.
In this work an M-2000 ellipsometer from J. A. Woollam with a spectral range from 250 nm to 1000 nm was used to measure $\Psi$ and $\Delta$ as a function of the wavelength. %for wavelengths between 250 and 1000 nm. %stimmt das? 245 bis 994 im HG, bei TDK bis 1700 nm möglich...alternativ: measured as a function of the wavelengths..
To extract physical properties of the measured thin films, such as the film thickness and the optical constants, an optical model is built. Thereby the dielectric function  $\epsilon$ is described as the sum of
excitations, which can be represented by oscillators \cite{Faltermeier.PhD}.
With such an optical model, SE data is generated and then fitted to the measured data by varying the model's parameters.  
A Tauc-Lorentz oscillator model \cite{Jellison.1996} was used to parameterize %the imaginary part of 
the dielectric function $\epsilon$ of a-Si:H, taking into account thin film absorption above the bandgap.
%leo:
%The model is specified by five parameters, representing the amplitude and broadening parameter of the oscillator, the optical band gap following the Tauc formula \cite{Tauc.1966}, the peak transition energy and a ?-independent contribution.
The model is specified by different parameters, representing the amplitude and broadening term ot the oscillator, the optical bandgap following the Tauc formula \cite{Tauc.1966} and the peak transition energy. %peak transition energy bedeutet die energy, bei der übergänge am wahrscheinlichsten sind, am häufigsten auftreten bzw. an dieser stelle gibt dann die amplitude die höhe und broadening factor die FWHM an. epsilon =0 für E<Eg hier. keine Urbach anregungen für E<Eg, diese werden bei Cody Lorentz berücksichtigt. 
Another free parameter during fitting is the film thickness.
SE measurements were always performed on planar Si substrates. 
All the thicknesses indicated in this work represent the effective physical film thickness. A factor of 1.5 was therefore assumed for thin films on a textured substrate in order to calculate the effective thickness from the thickness measured on planar sister samples.
 
To determine the crystalline fraction of partially crystallized Si layers after thermal treatments a so-called effective media approximation (EMA) model using a Bruggemann algorithm was used. It assumes different volume fractions of poly-Si, a-Si:H and voids in the thin film, whereby the volume fraction of poly-Si is taken as the crystalline fraction. For the measurement of poly-Si layers 100 nm of SiO$_x$ were used as an optical spacer between poly-Si and the c-Si substrate. %ist letzer satz nötig hier?

\section{Infrared spectroscopy}\label{sec:FTIR}

%zusammen mit SE unter optical? nee eigentlich ist das hier structural! SE wurde aber auch for allem für struktur untersuchungen verwendet!

Infrared light can excite vibrational modes which can change their dipole momentum, i.e., which are anti-symmetric to the center of 
the molecule. Hence infrared spectroscopy yields information on these vibrational modes by detecting the attenuated infrared radiation after passing through the sample. In this work, the stretching mode of Si-H bonds located at wavenumbers $\approx 1900-2200 ~\textrm{cm}^{-1}$ is of interest to investigate the microstructure of intrinsic a-Si:H passivation layers for SHJ solar cells (Section \ref{sec:microstructure}). 

For that, a Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) setup %Hersteller...? 
was used, which has the great benefit of measuring the absorption of the sample for frequencies in the range $400 - 4000 ~\textrm{cm}^{-1}$ simultaneously, instead of measuring the absorption over a narrow range of wavelengths at a time like in a dispersive spectrophotometer. To this end, the spectrum of a continuous light is converted into its interferogram via a Michelson interferometer \cite{Feldmann.PhD}. 

In the interferometer a beam splitter divides the incident light beam ideally into two equal beams. One is directed at a stationary mirror and the other is directed at a movable mirror. After reflection at the respective mirror, the two light beams interfere each other before passing the sample and being detected afterwards.
Constructive and destructive interference for each frequency depends on the optical path length difference between the two beams, which is controlled by the mirror position. By continuously moving the mirror an interferogram is recorded as a function of the different mirror positions \cite{AbouRas.}. The signal is then Fourier transformed from the spatial domain into
the frequency domain to obtain an absorption spectrum.
For an enhanced signal-to-noise ratio numerous movable mirror sweeps are averaged \cite{Schroder.2006}.

In order to increase the infrared absorption signal of the ultrathin layers of interest\footnotemark\footnotetext{The investigated a-Si:H($i$) layers were $\approx 9 ~\textrm{nm}$ thick.} a so-called attenuated total reflection (ATR) setup was used \cite{Fujiwara.1999,Chabal.1989} (Fig. \ref{fig:ATR}). To this end, the light is passed through a highly refractive germanium crystal, at the surface of which it is completely reflected several times. 
The sample is placed directly onto the crystal surface so
that it can absorb the evanescent wave.

%Information on the hydrogen content in the film can be obtained from the stretch-
%ing mode of the Si-H bonds (1900 ?? 2200??cm-1) and the CHn wagging mode 
%(1000??cm-1). In this frequency range the Si-O stretching mode which is a signature of 
%the grown oxide during annealing is also observed. In the as-deposited state it is 
%difficult to obtain information on the Si-C bond because of the neighboring features 
%of both the Si-CH3 (780??cm-1) and Si-H wagging mode (640??cm-1). Table 3-I gives an

With capacitance-voltage profiling ($C-V$) the charge carrier concentration $N$ of semiconductors can be determined.
The technique relies on the fact that the width of a reverse-biased
space-charge region of a semiconductor junction depends on the applied
voltage and $N$ in the semiconductor \cite{Schroder.2006}. 
Note that while (E)CV measures the net electrically active dopant concentration $N$, the total amount of doping impurities, whether they are electrically active or not, can be determined for example with secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS).
%is a standard method for the determination of active doping concentrations in semiconductors [44?47].
%Hack: Mott-Schottky model approximations of a one-sided junction in full depletion.
Assuming an entirely depleted space charge region with an abrupt edge and charge neutrality elsewhere (depletion approximation), the capacitance C is given by %schroder: This is a reasonably good approximation when the scr is reverse biased and when the substrate is uniformly doped. 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:capacitance}
	C \equiv \left| \frac{\textrm{d}Q}{\textrm{d}V} \right| = \left| \frac{I}{\frac{\textrm{d}V}{\textrm{d}t}} \right| \frac{\epsilon_s A_c}{w},
\end{equation}%so müsste man Q als Ladung einführen!
%Capacitance is usually defined as the stored charge between two conducting surfaces separated by a dielectric divided by the voltage between the surfaces.  Another definition is the rate of change of the stored charge or surface charge (?) divided by the rate of change of the voltage between the surfaces or the electric surface potential (?).  The latter is called the "differential capacitance," but usually the stored charge is directly proportional to the voltage, making the capacitances given by the two definitions equal. (wiki differential capacitance).
analogous to the case of a classic parallel-plate capacitor \cite{Straub.2005}. Substituting the depletion width $w$ from Eq. \ref{eq:depletion-width} into Eq. \ref{eq:capacitance} gives
\begin{equation}\label{eq:C-2}
	\frac{1}{C^2} = \frac{2}{q \epsilon_s A_c^2 N} (V_{bi}-V).
\end{equation}
%area A einführen? oder A_c hier verwenden?
%schroder: Since the area appears as A2, it is very important that the device area be precisely known for accurate doping profiling
The capacitance is measured by the current response of an AC signal which is superimposed on the DC bias voltage $V$ \cite{Schroder.2006}.
According to Eq. \ref{eq:C-2} by plotting $C^{-2}$ versus $V$ a straight line is obtained for a uniformly doped semiconductor fulfilling the depletion approximation.
From the slope the charge carrier concentration $N$ %on the more lowly doped side of the junction 
can be determined (negative slope for $p$- and positive slope for $n$-type doping), whereas the intercept with
the voltage axis gives the junction's built-in voltage $V_{bi}$ \cite{Straub.2005}.
%leoni.diss: What is actually being measured as the doping density in this case is the electron concentration around the depletion width, but as long as the doping density and conduction band are slowly varying the electron concentration and doping profiles should coincide.
%In actual CV measurements, the capacitance is measured by the current response of an AC signal which is superimposed on the DC bias voltage. If the AC signal is small compared to the DC bias, the capacitance can be treated as being approximately constant since the change in depletion depth is negligible

%The main restriction of this procedure is the limit of achievable profiling depth because of eventual breakdown with increasing reverse bias.

In \ac{ECV} an electrochemical cell is used to contact the semiconductor under study and to gradually etch into the sample between measurements to record a dopant depth profile. 
Such an electrochemical cell is schematically shown in Fig. \ref{fig:ECV}. The contact is formed by pressing the sample against the sealing ring of the cell, the size of which determines the contact area $A_c$. 
%For good contact formation, the doping concentration $N >! 10^{18} ~\textrm{cm}^{-3}$. Therefore, in this work, only poly-Si layers could be measured. SHJ samples could not be measured...
In this work, a solution of ammonium hydrogen difluoride (NH$_4$HF$_2$) is used as electrolyte. The DC voltage to control both the etching process and the $C-V$ measurements is applied by passing a DC current between the semiconductor and the carbon
electrode at a constant potential relative to the reference electrode. %A saturated calomel electrode (SCE) serves as reference.
A platinum electrode near the sample's surface measures the response to the AC signal.
%For details on the etching process it is kindly referred to Ref. ....
The etching step depends on holes drawn from the semiconductor bulk to the electrolyte/semiconductor interface by applying a voltage. These holes oxidize the surface Si atoms by removing valency electrons. Ionized Si$^{4+}$ atoms are then dissolved in the electrolyte. %built complexes with the fluorine in the electrolyte and are thus %referenz für komplexe??
%(electrochemically) dissolved. 
To dissolve $n$-type material holes are generated via illuminating the sample through the electrolyte (Fig. \ref{fig:ECV}).
%Schroder: Depth profiling is achieved by dissolving the semiconductor electrolytically, which depends on the presence of holes
The output depth for the concentration profile is the sum of the etched depth, determined from the
integrated etch current between sample and counter electrode using Faraday's law \cite{Blood.1986}, and the depletion width $w$ obtained by the capacitance measurement. %By measuring the involved current flow between the sample and the counter electrode Ie over time, the etched depth xe can be obtained using Faraday?s law [44]:
%????= ??????????????????????0 ,
%with M being the molar mass of the semiconductor material, z the valency factor, i.e. the number of charge carriers that have to be transferred to dissolve one atom, F the Faraday constant, D the density of the sample material and A the measurement area.
%This is the reason why doping profiles from different samples are not always aligned, since the measured depletion widths can differ and therefore shift the data points.
For a comprehensive discussion of $C-V$ profiling the reader is kindly referred to Refs. \cite{Blood.1986, Straub.2005, Schroder.2006}.

%For the samples that were processed within this work, the silicon oxide layer (SiOx, compare section 4.1) can serve as point of reference, as it is sometimes indicated by a data point with higher error or falsely detected p-doping. This can result from measuring within the insulating SiOx.


%Contrary to what one might expect, the valency factor z in equation (3.3) does not necessarily equal the theoretical number of valency electrons of a material (4 for Si). One of the reasons is that for the case of Si, the dissolved ionized atoms can react further with the electrolyte to another ionization state eventually forming gaseous H2, which is removed after each step in an additional pump cycle. Therefore, this parameter is corrected to a value of 3.77 for the dissolution of crystalline Si in the electrolyte used [44].

%The presence of dislocations and grain boundaries in poly-Si which could enable transfer of charge carriers directly to the electrolyte without interacting with surface atoms, yielding small uncertainties for the etch depth.
%However, this effect has not been accounted for in this work since this would only have a small influence on the results and is irrelevant for the discussion of the behavior of our layers.


%penn: In the case of polycrystalline Si further uncertainties can arise from the presence of dislocations and grain boundaries which could enable the transport of charge carriers directly to the electrolyte without interacting with surface atoms, yielding a slightly incorrect etch depth. However, this effect has not been accounted for in this work since this would only have a small influence on the results and is irrelevant for the discussion of the behavior of our layers.

%The change from p-type to n-type doping at pn junctions often results in data points that are afflicted with higher errors, which have been concealed in this work for better visibility. 

%Also other sources of error, coming from steep concentration edges or the incorporation of other elements like carbon are present.
